##### About
BIOS is a product made by Agrotes de l'espace, a team of 6 undergrads from India, working towards a common goal with passion. Our aim is to create fully autonomous and scalable space plantation pods which are not only practical and goal-serving, but efficient at that.
As someone once said, "The greatest oak was once a little nut who held its ground.", we believe that these efforts of ours can one day truly serve humanity in space one day.
